mwm
---

mwm is a window manager aimed at media center PCs. A main feature is being
able to control the window management from other sources than X inputs, e.g.
from a web server.

Currently all windows are shown in fullscreen, and it is possible to switch
between windows using alt+j and alt+k. alt+q quits the window manager.
